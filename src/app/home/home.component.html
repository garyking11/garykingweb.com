                    Gary is a very knowledgable developer with thoughtful insights on perfecting processes. He has
                    taken
                    on several projects that helped streamline builds for our team and has created templates and
                    widgets
                    to make our websites look even more modern. He is friendly and easy to work with and always
                    always willing to offer help to his teammates. I highly recommend him!

                    Gary is a very innovative web developer with an impressive level of knowledge of overall web
                    development, including but not limited to responsive design, UI tools, and making highly
                    reusable
                    boilerplate templates from scratch. I had the pleasure of working with him on an application
                    component that allows for real time template color changes that utilized CSS, LESS, JavaScript,
                    AJAX, and PHP. His desire to make innovative tools that users will actually enjoy using really
                    shows in his work. We learned a lot from each other by working on that product and sharing our
                    knowledge on how to make it better. I have zero hesitation in saying that he would be a valuable
                    asset on any design or development team.

                    Gary was our go-to developer for anything tricky. He has a passion for solving complex questions
                    with usable solutions. Gary is always looking for that better/faster/prettier way to accomplish
                    the
                    desired result. His creative and fun personality, paired with his incredible technical
                    abilities,
                    make him a vital asset to any team. I highly recommend Gary.

                    I have worked with Gary for a couple of years at Sesame Communications. Gary was often the one
                    that
                    created the sites that I was managing. I could always count on him for solid builds and the
                    willingness to try new things. He has been an important asset in helping us streamline processes
                    and efficiencies of the web team. Gary is great to work with and a valuable asset to any team.

                    Gary is one of my all-time favorite web developers. His work is clean and beautiful. He is able
                    to
                    tackle crazy requests that we've never done before (mobile features, responsive template
                    designs,
                    in-house CMS, automated features, etc) and he keeps a pleasant demeanor and clear communication
                    with the rest of the team. I highly recommend Gary for front end and back end development, and
                    hope to work with him again someday!

                    work
                    ethic. He is a seasoned web developer with advanced skills in html5, php, jQuery, php
                    frameworks,
                    CMS, and Adobe Creative Suite. I would highly recommend Gary. He would be a great asset to any

                    He speaks his mind at meetings with other teams with solutions to remove roadblocks for all
